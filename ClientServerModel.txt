Client server model:
Many databases applications are built using client-server model. The program itself relies on client machine and sends requests to a database server for information.

The requests are done with SQL. Typically for each SQL query it results in many network trips.

However many SQL statements can be bundled together into one PL/SQL block and sent to server as a single unit.
